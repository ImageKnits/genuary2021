This is a small collection of JavaScript programs with visual output written for the [#genuary2021](https://genuary2021.github.io/) challenge on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_matthiasjaeger/). Click on the image to visit a demo or use the link in the the title to get the code for each sketch. I used [p5-js](https://p5js.org) as my main renderer and these self written tools: [p5-toolkit](https://github.com/matthias-jaeger-net/p5-toolkit), [p5-glitch-effects](https://github.com/matthias-jaeger-net/p5-glitch-effects), [colorful-stripes](https://github.com/matthias-jaeger-net/colorful-stripes). All examples are stored in [genuary2021](https://github.com/matthias-jaeger-net/genuary2021) and hosted live as github pages [here](https://matthias-jaeger-net.github.io/genuary2021/).

## [Triple nested loop](https://github.com/matthias-jaeger-net/genuary2021/tree/main/genuary-1)

Exploring the flow of a triple nested for loop in a webgl canvas.

## [rule 30](https://github.com/matthias-jaeger-net/genuary2021/tree/main/genuary-2)

I went for the standard 2D implementation with a initial randomly seeded row and then took it to 3D. I render cells that are alive as textured boxes and dead cells as textured planes.I modulate the height of the boxes with 2D noise for decorative reasons.

## [Make something human](https://github.com/matthias-jaeger-net/genuary2021/tree/main/genuary-3)

During the lockdons due to the corona virus I missed seeing my human friends in real life the the most. When feeling lonely I'd take an A3 page and doodle large imaginairy faces with a big brush and acrylic paint. I'm not such a good painter, so I didn't share these portraits so far. For today's challenge I overlay the images with effects from my javascript library and gave them a final touch in the digital world.

## [Small areas of symmetry](https://github.com/matthias-jaeger-net/genuary2021/tree/main/genuary-4)

I traveled along random angles of a circle and at every angle sketched a rectangle on the page. Using my function sym() I cut small areas of the canvas and show the image next to a reflected version of itself.

## [Do some code golf!](https://github.com/matthias-jaeger-net/genuary2021/tree/main/genuary-5)

How little code can you write to make something interesting? I made noisy black dots.

## [Triangle subdivision](https://github.com/matthias-jaeger-net/genuary2021/tree/main/genuary-6)

Wrote several functions that help me get this simple animation done. The geometry you see is calculated from 3 given vectors and rotated, styled and diplayed in a p5 WEBGL canvas.

## Generate some rules, then follow them by hand on paper
```
Take a paper
Take a pen
Move at a random location
Pen down
Move at a random location
Wiggle or not

## [Curve only](https://github.com/matthias-jaeger-net/genuary2021/tree/main/genuary-8)

Inspired by floral drawings and minimalist aestethics I imagine a wild composition of blades of grass in a virtual landscape.

## [Interference patterns](https://github.com/matthias-jaeger-net/genuary2021/tree/main/genuary-9)

Simple circles moving on the screen shape beautiful patterns.
